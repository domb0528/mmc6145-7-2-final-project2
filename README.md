# Recipe Search App

This is a simple web application that allows users to search for recipes based on specified nutrient values using the Spoonacular API. Users can enter the desired nutrient values as search parameters, and the app will fetch and display recipes that match the given criteria.

## Prerequisites

To run this application, you'll need the following:

- Web browser with JavaScript enabled
- A valid Spoonacular API key. You can sign up for an API key on the Spoonacular website.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/domb0528/mmc6145-7-2-final-project2
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd domb0528/mmc6145-7-2-final-project2
```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can do this by double-clicking on the file or by using your browser's "Open File" option.

## How to Use the App

1. Open the app in your web browser.
2. You will see a search bar with a label "Enter minimum Carbs" and an input field next to it.
3. Enter the minimum amount of carbohydrates you want the recipes to contain in the input field.
4. Click the "Search" button.
5. The app will fetch recipes from the Spoonacular API that meet the specified criteria and display the recipe titles in a list below the search bar.

## Note

- The Spoonacular API key is necessary for the application to work correctly. Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` in the `script.js` file with your actual Spoonacular API key.
- The search results will be limited to recipes that match the entered nutrient values. If no recipes are found with the given criteria, a message indicating that no recipes were found will be displayed.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the app or have questions, feel free to reach out to us at support@example.com.
